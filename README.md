## Why use Maelstrom?
Unlike other solutions such as Nova - Maelstrom doesn't impose any ways on doing things, we simply provide you various helpers to either use, or ignore - allowing you to implement things exactly as you need. Utilising the IoC container, waterfall includes, extendable UI components and a controversial god class, everything can be changed to suit your needs with ease.

### The Stack
Maelstrom uses a cutting edge stack to afford you the ability to create the most advanced systems, unlike many other systems we don't use any Bootstrap themes, it's a pure utility class based interface using Tailwind and the UI library from Ant Design to allow you to create what ever you need.
